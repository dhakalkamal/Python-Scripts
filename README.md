# Python-Scripts

This repo contains important python workarounds to help train the different Neural Networks for images. As it may sound trivial to train the image dataset for Classification and dection purposes but there are several hurdles in training the custom images. So, these scripts are often used to ease the process of training custom image datasets. The scripts here are used for quickly hacking data augmentation, changing different images dataset formats, working with xlm, csv json dataset, resizing of images and many more tasks.
